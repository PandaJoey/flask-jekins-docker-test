This creates a Blueprint named 'auth'. Like the application object, 
the blueprint needs to know where it’s defined, so __name__ is 
passed as the second argument. The url_prefix will be prepended 
to all the URLs associated with the blueprint.

Import and register the blueprint from the factory using 
app.register_blueprint(). Place the new code at the end 
of the factory function before returning the app.

bp = Blueprint('auth', __name__, url_prefix='/auth')


"""
@bp.route associates the URL /register with the register 
view function. When Flask receives a request to /auth/register, 
it will call the register view and use the return value as 
the response.

db.execute takes a SQL query with ? placeholders for any user 
input, and a tuple of values to replace the placeholders with. 
The database library will take care of escaping the values so 
you are not vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.
            
For security, passwords should never be stored in the database 
directly. Instead, generate_password_hash() is used to securely 
hash the password, and that hash is stored. Since this query 
modifies data, db.commit() needs to be called afterwards to 
save the changes.
                
An sqlite3.IntegrityError will occur if the username already exists,
which should be shown to the user as another validation error.

After storing the user, they are redirected to the login page. 
url_for() generates the URL for the login view based on its name. 
This is preferable to writing the URL directly as it allows you 
to change the URL later without changing all code that links to it. redirect() generates a redirect response to the generated URL.

fetchone() returns one row from the query.

session is a dict that stores data across requests. 
When validation succeeds, the users id is stored in a new session. 
The data is stored in a cookie that is sent to the browser,

The url_for() function generates the URL to a view based on 
a name and arguments. The name associated with a view 
is also called the endpoint, and by default its the
same as the name of the view function.

For example, the hello() view that was added to the app 
factory earlier in the tutorial has the name 'hello' 
and can be linked to with url_for('hello'). If it took 
an argument, which youll see later, it would be linked 
to using url_for('hello', who='World').

When using a blueprint, the name of the blueprint is 
prepended to the name of the function, so the endpoint 
for the login function you wrote above is 'auth.login'
because you added it to the 'auth' blueprint.
